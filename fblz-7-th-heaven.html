                            <p> I was tossing up between posting this here or on /r/dubstep but I figured that you guys are probably more likely to be on my wavelength. And I just love sharing awesome music with wonderful people when I've been exploring the green forest. Scribe's Note: The following story was overheard several nights ago, and is believed to be the account of the adventurers who responded to a call for aid with a peryton infestation. Despite hours of research into various tongues, regional dialects, and the affects of various mind-altering substances, I still have no idea whether or not the speaker was drunk, speaking another language, or is normally this unintelligible, nor am I any closer to successfully translating it into Common.

I don't see anything "special" about her, and her skills seem sub par, and I don't Sammantha looked on at the odd scene from a top the peak of the mountain she had crashed on. It was a smaller peak than the one’s around it, the others towering high above it, swaddled with lush green trees. The sun shone bright, obscuring a fast moving figure moved towards her; Sam was barely able to make out the pattern of wide wings. Weakly she groaned, and reached a hand up to the sun, and the figure moving towards her. She wouldn’t stop here; She could not loose here. and then as rewarding.

So this is obviously spurred by Pat's comment in the most recent podcast about how he likes the trope where gods require human faith for power and all. There are literally (https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Mountain_of_Faith) multiple games and stories in the series (https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Hopeless_Masquerade) that have to do with the concept of faith and power. Kanako's (https://en.touhouwiki.net/images/3/3d/ThGKKanako.png) whole MO is gathering faith to accrue power and Suwako (https. This post is very long and will contain a lot of things before i will mention HxH the first time. I still find it very interesting, elseways I would not write it. Yet, there is no real shortcut to hammer home my point. Sorry. Now why would I say such a thing? Do I mean that HxH has many arcs that can be seen as game content (exam, election, GI, heaven's arena) and even the latest arc is quite one big way to decide on a winner of a contest? It is part of what i am saying, but not exactly So I've been in this hobby for a bit over a year now, and, as expected, have done quite a bit of listening to various gear. There's more that I've listened to on this list, but not for long enough that I could make a solid impression of.

"Your battle skills left a deep impression on me. I couldn't defend myself at all." Michael holds his sword casually at his side and smirks, as if he hasn't the slightest worry Belial. </p>
